I attempted to find if it is possible to differentiate between more plain-text and more "artistic" text.

Thus, I applied Parts-Of-Speech tagging to the given texts and counted the number of nouns, verbs and adjectives.
The results are listed in the summary file "summary.csv".

My hope was that more adjectives should probably result in more artistic text.

1) For most of the given text, the percentage of the adjectives to the total number of words for that author is between 5 to 7 percent.

2) The author "Unknown" showed the least percent, about 4%. This is the story of Aladdin and the magic lamp. The language of that text
   seems quite simple (plain) English.

3) The percetange of adjectives is greater for authors like "WEBDuBois" (The souls of black folk), Phillis Wheatley (Religious and Moral poems)
   and John Milton (Paradise Regained). Reading these text files, seems like they are either poems or have more old English text and generally
   more artistic.
   
 Thus, with the preliminary experiment, it seems that there is some correlation between the number of adjectives in text and its artistic content.
 It will be an interesting experiment to compare news articles and poems / more literature heavy "artistic" text and develop a classifier that
 could potentially classify text as more plain-language or artistic.
